			Updates

			 * The Advancement tree has been greatly expanded. Many many more advancements are now available, and some give XP rewards.
			 * Significant performance improvement for the Refinery: now uses far less CPU when idle, and significantly less when processing.
			 * Significant performance improvement for the Pressure Chamber, which was unnecessarily recalculating recipes every tick (when it only needed to recalculate when chamber contents changed).
			 * Pressure Chamber now plays a quiet "pop" sound when crafting occurs (not more than once per 5 ticks, and you need to be pretty close to hear it).
			 * Camouflaging updates:
			 * Connected textures are now supported! With thanks to Botania; I figured out how to do this by looking at the Abstruse Platform code.
			 * Breaking a camouflaged block now breaks off the camouflage without breaking the underlying block.
			 * Applying the same camouflage to a block twice now just plays a click and does nothing (previously it reapplied the camo block, unnecessarily using pressure from the Camo Applicator).
			 * Some JEI work:
			 * Added support for Heat Frame Cooling recipes (by default just lava bucket->obsidian and water bucket->ice, but recipes can be added with CraftTweaker).
			 * Recipes which show a pressure gauge (Pressure Chamber, Thermopneumatic Processing Plant) now have a tooltip on the gauge graphic showing the exact pressure required.
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant recipes which don't care about pressure (Lubricant & Plastic by default) no longer show the pressure gauge at all.
			 * JEI now shows Pressure Chamber enchanting & disenchanting recipes.
			Fixes

			 * Pressure Chamber GUI: "Pressure" side tab now shows correct Volume information for the chamber.
			 * Fixed visual bug where Pressure Tubes would appear to disconnect after a Tube Module GUI was closed.
			 * Fixed not being able to manually insert oil into a Refinery by right-clicking with a fluid container in hand.
			 * Fixed side checkboxes in RF Import/Export puzzle pieces being ignored (drones would always try to access all sides until one side succeeded)
