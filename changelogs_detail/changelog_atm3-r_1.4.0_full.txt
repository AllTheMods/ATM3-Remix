			!!! BACKUP YOUR WORLDS BEFORE UPDATING !!!

			With support for 1.13.x coming soon, I've made the first step and flattened all my blocks and items. This are the blocks/items affected:

			- Yellorite ore, Benitoite ore, Anglesite ore
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel metal blocks (and their item forms)
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel ingots and dusts
			- Benitoite and Anglesite crystals

			If you have those items in chests/storage/machines other then vanillas one YOU MUST move them to vanilla chests before updating or you end up loosing them.

			Many mods do not use the system vanilla have in place to address this kind of changes. Iron Chests form the Iron Chest mod are OK (if you are using version 1.12.2-7.0.59.842 or newer of Iron Chest the other chest types should be OK too)

			The full changelog is following
