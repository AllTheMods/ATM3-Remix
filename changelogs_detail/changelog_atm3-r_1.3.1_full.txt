			0.10.5-346 (29 Apr 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Hotfix: fix crashes due to null ItemStack field in Charging Station tile entity (manifested either as server crashes on world load or client crashes when rendering the Charging Station charged item)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#0104-343-28-apr-2019)0.10.4-343 (28 Apr 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#new)New

			 * Added a Reinforced Air Canister, which can hold up to 120000mL of air at 20 bar. These can be used (with a little design) as a wireless pressure transfer mechanism using a couple of Aerial Interfaces & Charging Modules and a (vanilla) Ender Chest...
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Plastic Mixer can now be configured to accept alternative input fluids, either via Java API or via CraftTweaker.
			 * Ratio of liquid to solid plastic sheets can be defined on a per-input basis too.
			 * CT docs will be added to [https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Mods/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fcrafttweaker.readthedocs.io%252fen%252flatest%252f%2523Mods%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252f) but see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/326](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/326) for now.
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant updates:
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now runs up to 2.5 times as fast if given more heat than the minimum recipe requirement; heat will also be consumed more quickly, but it's slightly more efficient in terms of heat usage to run the plant hotter than the minimum.
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now emits smoke particles when running.
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant GUI now shows required temperature in heat gauge tooltip.
			 * JEI version 4.12.0 or later is now required.
			 * Refinery smoke particles are now all handled client-side, reducing server->client traffic when the Refinery is running.
			 * Pressurizable items now draw their durability bar in a light blue colour (darkening as the pressure decreases). Since the bar is showing air and not actual damage, this differentiates it from a normal item damage bar.
			 * The pressure bar is now always shown on pressurizable items, even when full. If you prefer the old behaviour, set the clientside alwaysShowPressureDurabilityBar config setting to false.
			 * Pneumatic Armor now shows the new-style pressure bar in addition to the existing durability bar.
			 * Pneumatic Chestplate Magnet Upgrade will no longer pull unfinished PCB's from Etching Acid pools.
			 * Pneumatic Chestplate Security Upgrade now provides electrical protection from Immersive Engineering wiring. You will not be injured, but air will be used from the chestplate to provide this protection. Knockback is not prevented.
			 * Similarly, a Security Upgrade in a Drone will protect it from IE wiring, also at an air cost. Drones didn't get knocked back by the shock in any case.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-1)Fixes

			 * Fixed crash in Programmable Controller when running a program which refers to the $owner special variable. The Programmable Controller's owner's (head) position is now returned, as expected.
			 * Fixed Thermopneumatic Processing Plant sometimes forgetting what it was supposed to be doing.
			 * GPS Area Tools may now be used when setting an area widget's position via the inventory search GUI (previously this caused a crash). Note that when the area tool contains multiple positions, an arbitrary position will be selected.
			 * Aerial Interface now properly enforces minimum pressure requirements for moving items in & out.
			 * Fixed item dupe issue relating to Drones with Magnet Upgrades in certain circumstances.
			 * Fixed excessive packet sending causing FPS drops with Charging Station and UV Light Box when items were being processed.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.10.3-337.jar:
			New

			 * Experimental Immersive Engineering heat integration
			 * Immersive Engineering External Heater will supply heat to PneumaticCraft machines (Refinery etc.) if given RF (Forge Energy)
			 * By default it uses 100RF/t to provide 1 heat unit; this can be changed in config (pneumaticcraft.cfg -> "integration" section)
			 * A redstone signal to the heater will stop it providing heat to PneumaticCraft (but it will continue to charge RF)
			 * Can be disabled entirely by setting ieExternalHeaterRFperTick to 0 in config
			 * NOTE: highly-experimental and subject to possible significant retuning for balance purposes
			 * Experimental Mekanism heat integration
			 * PNC and Mekansim machines will now exchange heat with each other
			 * Heat exchange properties can be configured in pneumaticcraft.cfg -> "integration" section
			 * Can be disabled entirely by setting mekHeatEfficiency to 0.0 in config
			 * NOTE: should be considered even more experimental than the Immersive Engineering integration! Heavily subject to possible rebalancing.
			 * Aerial Interface now has Baubles support
			 * Any FE (RF etc.) items in your Baubles slots will now be charged by the Aerial Interface
			 * The GUI Side Configuration tab now also has the ability to connect a face of the block to your Baubles inventory, if available
			 * Added a Creative Upgrade item, for use in the Omnidirectional and Liquid Hoppers. This allows them to infinitely dispense items/fluids.
			 * A liquid hopper with a Creative Upgrade will also act as an infinite fluid sink if it receives any fluid that it already contains
			 * Dispenser Upgrade can now be configured with a direction
			 * Right-click any block to set the direction to the clicked face, right-click air to clear the direction
			 * This is used by the Gas Lift and Thermopneumatic Processing Plant to enforce a specific direction to eject fluids to
			 * If no direction is defined, outputs are searched in D-U-N-S-W-E order, as before.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Got rid of the "Dump Input" button from the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant GUI. This isn't necessary anymore, since the TPP doesn't accept fluids that it can't process.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed another startup crash related to BlockHeatProperties.cfg (so many edge cases...) - this one occurred with fluids that don't have an associated block.
			 * When hiding the GUI (with F1 by default), Pneumatic Armor HUD is now also properly hidden
			 * Fixed minor problem with Air Grate vacuuming mode where items could get caught on edges, e.g. farmland->block transition
			 * Slightly increased Air Grate vacuum mode range for adjacent inventory insertion (items could get stuck just outside insertion range)

			 - Fixed a problem with the screen dump module not working properly in some cases
			 - Fixed a problem with the wireless logic block not correctly sending a block update to the destination block
			 - Fixed the digit logic block not always updating visually
			 - Lykrast maded machines face the user in first person, like pumpkins do. This means you now see the front of the machine instead of the side/back when holding in your hand.
			 - Tcheinen added comparator functions for the modular storage block. Like vanilla chests it will return 0 when empty, 15 when full, and for all other cases (number of stacks/max stacks) * 14 + 1

	RFTools Control (went from RFToolsControl - 1.12-1.9.3 to RFToolsControl - 1.12-2.0.2):

			 - Fixed dropping liquid buckets in the fluid opcodes
			 - Small improvement on error logging. The index of the program card that is causing the error is now also printed
			 - There was a chance that a programmer would not correctly save its current program on exit. Loading the world again would revert to an older program. This has now been fixed

			 - New 'test_eq_item' opcode which is a more flexible way to test for item equality. It can optionally use metadata, NBT, and oredictionary to do the equality test
			 - Fixed a problem where opcodes that work with 'numbers' didn't have access to functions that return integers
			 - The 'eval_tuple' opcode now also has a way to get a tuple from a variable
