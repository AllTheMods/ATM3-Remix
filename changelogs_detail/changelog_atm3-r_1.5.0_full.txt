	Forge MultiPart CBE (went from ForgeMultipart 1.12.2-2.6.1.81-universal to ForgeMultipart 1.12.2-2.6.2.83-universal):

			No changelog provided.

	Immersive Engineering (went from Immersive Engineering 0.12 - 89 to Immersive Engineering 0.12 - 91)

	In Control! (went from InControl - 1.12-3.9.13 to InControl - 1.12-3.9.16):
		InControl - 1.12-3.9.16:
			 - Fixed a problem where 'onjoin' rules were also firing on the client which could cause issues with some of the conditions that don't properly work on the client
		InControl - 1.12-3.9.15:
			 - Worked around a problem caused in the previous version. The issue was that there was both a condition called 'helditem' as well as an action called 'helditem'. For spawns the condition has been renamed to 'playerhelditem'. It is recommended to use this in other places as well (when used as a condition)
		InControl - 1.12-3.9.14:
			 - Implemented a much requested feature with the spawn rules. That is support for gamestages. In Control will use the closest player (with a configurable maximum distance of 100). In addition keywords like helditem, helmet, trinker, ... are now also supported for spawn rules

		industrialcraft-2-2.8.183-ex112.jar:
			* Become slightly distracted from the task at hand Heat sinks still need implementing, but why not start redesigning the Steam Boiler instead? With heat no longer so clear cut the experience needs to be improved somewhat to account for it Currently doesn't do anything other than heat up and look pretty (Chocohead)
			* Fix pump battery slot ignoring upgrades Fixes #2594 (Chocohead)
			* Add a mechanism to average heat over time Allows summarising an analogue process a little easier Allows compacting a SolidHeat instance down to a relative float value, which is also the string representation Moves networking additions to a single place (Chocohead)
			* Add a toggle group GUI element Makes for slightly easier radio buttons (Chocohead)
		industrialcraft-2-2.8.182-ex112.jar:

			* Allow creating SolidHeat instances on demand Reduces object churn for large surfaces which change heat frequently (Chocohead)
			* Implement a notion of conductivity Allows heat aware tiles to change the heat conductivity alongside temperature differences Also fixes a bug with heat balancing designed to avoid over sharing which still over shared (Chocohead)
			* Mount specific heat capacity to SolidHeat Realistically the cases where SolidHeat is important the specific heat capacity is too Also makes SolidHeat final to encourage the JVM to be more magic (Chocohead)
			* Fix heat tinting around solid blocks Will now use the surrounding block lights for each face which should stop it going completely black (Chocohead)
		industrialcraft-2-2.8.180-ex112.jar:
			* Avoid shading crop sticks Fixes #2543 (Chocohead)
			* Add pair of heat (unaware) sinks Column will need some more appropriate colours (Chocohead)
			* Copy less, loop more Probably actually much more expensive to what was before it, but cleaner Still feel like there's a proper/sensible way to do with too (Chocohead)
			* Fix the rubber tree item model Turns out what broke in 1.9 was parent item transforms stacked instead of being ignored Thus dropping Forge's inappropriate ones makes it work again Fixes #2409 and #2558 (Chocohead)
		industrialcraft-2-2.8.179-ex112.jar:
			* Fix Crop providedQuality. (estebes)
		industrialcraft-2-2.8.178-ex112.jar:
			* Use OreDictionary for iridium related recipes. Adjust values for the Cropmatron and CropHarvester. (estebes)
		industrialcraft-2-2.8.177-ex112.jar:
			* Fix treetapping non-resin logs still consuming durability Fixes #2584 (Chocohead)
			* More work on specific heat capacity (Chocohead)
			* Minor cleanup (Chocohead)
			* Switch to interfaces for heat awareness Begins splitting the concept of apparent temperature and true heat for modelling specific heat capacity (Chocohead)
			* Avoid pushing every build as a release We've had 170 now, back to betas (Chocohead)

			 • New Maniacal Dendrologist Advancement, for all of the hardcore lumberjacks and explorers out there.
			 • Moon Dial. It tells you the phase of the moon.
			 • Golden Minotaur Axe. Sporting a whopping 32 durability, this axe made of butter will occasionally appear in the place of a Golden Axe in a Minotaur's hand!

			 • Patchouli Integration, we now have a logbook to guide players if they have Patchouli installed!
