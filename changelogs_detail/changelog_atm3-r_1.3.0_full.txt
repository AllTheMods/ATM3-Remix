		MPBasic Tools 1.4.11 (1.12.2):
			Version 1.4.10

			 * InfoPanel's will no longer replace any other screen on entering world if it opens before the InfoPanel. (Issue reported cause replacing Prestige mod Gui)
			 * You can now queue up a few infopanels, and after you close one it will open up the next one. Can be done via commands running multiple commands.
			Version 1.4.8

			 * InfoPanel's on servers would open up randomly for players, when others logged in for the first time (If infopanel was set to trigger on first login).
			Version 1.4.7

			 * Fixed issue with using the in-game editor not saving files in correct format.
			Version 1.4.6

			 * Added new config options for the new onscreen notification system
			 * New '/mpa reload' command to reload all the configs related to info-panels & onscreen notification
			 * New config options to change background and border color on the onscreen notification
			 * Textures have been fixed on Quick Commands a few updates ago.
			 * Textures fixed on the mod pack version drop-down notification
			Version 1.4.5

			 * New Overlay hud item. On screen notifications
			 * On screen notification is configurable via a json file in your mputils/addons/mpbasic folder.
			 * New Command to trigger on screen Notifications "/mpa notify <player name> <notification id>"
			Version 1.4.4

			 * Fix issue with Crash on certain worlds (Believe it has to do with Fake players)
			Version 1.4.1

			 * InfoPanels should be finalized. Check the pre-generated files in your config file.
			 * InfoPanels can be trigged on first world load.
			 * If a 'must read' is set in your json file. It will create a small 10sec timer before they can close the window.
			 * New Command was added '/mpa infopanel <player> <givebook / opengui> <json filename>' (Use tab autocomplete)
			 * You can also give a player a book via the infopanel command or /give command and adding specific NBT data.
			 * Infopanels will give you a way to inform your users of certain aspects of the game. It can have multiple pages or you can have an infopanel for every occasion.
			 * Works on both servers and clients. But the config files have to be present on both ends for it to work.
			Version 1.3.4

			 * Trial run of infopanels.. check configs for options..
			 * Big update to change log.. if you got strange characters.. its because they were writing in one encoding and reading in another.
			 * Please change your file encodings to UTF-8 with notpad++ in a drop down menu you can convert.. or just create a new file with utf-8 encoding. This will make sure all platforms see the same thing.

	Mantle (went from Mantle-1.12-1.3.3.42.jar to Mantle-1.12-1.3.3.49.jar):
		Mantle-1.12-1.3.3.49.jar:
			 * Fixed extra hearts not bouncing during regen

		mekanica-1.12.2-1.2.0.jar:
			Major changes since 1.1.2:
			* Continued work on reducing memory usage of models
			* Remastered all sounds to a lower volume; honor config settings for volume
			adjustment
			* Removed all legacy IInventory automation; refactored logic around how
			pipes/cables connect so they follow the marked areas on machines
			* Improved performance/behavior of Logistical Transporters; they are much
			lighter on server now and more efficient when moving large numbers of items
			* Fixed some IC2 errors
			* Reduced idle tick overhead of Digital Miner
			* Add ES translation (thanks JonMaker050!)

			 * Lots of work on the Logistics system:
			 * Very major performance improvements for Logistics, both for Logistics Modules and Logistics Drones. Smarter caching of discovered logistics frames means a large reduction in server CPU used.
			 * Logistics frames now have a facing direction, which tells Logistics Drones which side to access the framed inventory on. Not important for non-sided inventories like chests, but very important for sided inventories such as Furnaces or the Aerial Interface.
			 * The facing direction defaults to the clicked face of the inventory it's placed on. Logistics frames placed before this change will face up by default; you can adjust the facing from within the GUI with the new "Facing" side tab.
			 * Logistics Modules ignore the frame's facing and always use the side of the inventory they face.
			 * Requester Frames can now specify the minimum amount of items or fluid to transfer at a time. This avoids situations where Logistics Drones could end up making constant trips moving 1mB of fluid at a time (e.g. moving fuel from a Refinery output to a Liquid Compressor).
			 * Significant overhaul of the Heat system:
			 * Block heat properties can now be specified in the config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg config file. Modpack makers, you're free to edit this file - entries you've changed won't be overwritten by future mod updates, although new entries could be added. (Note that this will likely become a datapack if & when I port to MC 1.13/1.14).
			 * Several other mod blocks and fluids now have useful heat properties, for heating or cooling PneumaticCraft machines:
			 * IC2 and Immersive Engineering Uranium blocks are not very hot but will last for ages before turning into Lead (not 4.46 billion years, though)
			 * IC2 Coolant & Hot Coolant are highly effective for heating & cooling purposes
			 * IC2 Steam & Superheated Steam are also useful, though not as good as Coolant
			 * Natura Heat Sand will emit a decent amount of heat before turning to Sand
			 * Thermal Foundation Enderium Blocks are unnaturally cold and will absorb a lot of heat before turning to Platinum
			 * Cryotheum is still an excellent coolant but now turns to Snow instead of Stone
			 * Quark blaze lamps are good heat sources, and will turn to Glowstone blocks
			 * Quark brimstone and permafrost are decent heat sources - not particularly hot/cold, but will last a while, and will turn to Cobblestone
			 * If you add a modded block or fluid entry which is generally useful, I will happily add that to the default list above. Just raise a github issue or (even better) a pull request.
			 * Note that all fluids have heat properties; a fluid's temperature is mod-defined, but its thermal resistance, total heat capacity and block transitions can all be overridden in config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg.
			 * Custom block heat properties now allow for a block transition both for hot and cold (e.g. IC2 steam becomes superheated steam if too much heat is absorbed, and water if too much heat is lost). Previously only a hot or cold transition was possible.
			 * Ambient temperature is no longer a flat 22C, but varies by biome and altitude
			 * Plains biome at sea level is 27C
			 * Ambient temperature drops above Y=80 and below Y=40 (by 0.1C per block by default, but configurable)
			 * Temperature variations are configurable in config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg and can be disabled entirely if you want (set "ambientTemperatureBiomeModifier" and "ambientTemperatureHeightModifier" to 0)
			 * This makes biomes like Deserts great for running a Refinery, but less great for running advanced compressors (not impossible, just less efficient), and vice versa for biomes like Taiga or Extreme Hills.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates-1)Updates

			 * Charged and active Pneumatic Boots will no longer trample farmland.
			 * Some Patchouli guidebook additions and improvements. Added missing page for the Logistics puzzle piece.
			 * The Refinery, Thermopneumatic Processing Plant and Plastic Mixer now warn in their GUI if the block is poorly insulated, and thus wasting heat (Plastic Mixer only warns if you're trying to melt down plastic).
			 * The Plastic Mixer now remembers any dye in its internal buffers if the block is broken and put down again, avoiding dye wastage if you need to move the machine.
			 * Added "/dumpNBT" command (op level), which dumps the NBT of the currently-held item as a JSON string. Primarily intended for getting internal Forge fluid names from a bucket of the fluid, for adding to custom fluid properties to config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg, but is also generally useful for debugging purposes.
			 * Pressure chamber textures don't look quite as flat now.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-2)Fixes

			 * Fixed two or more Transfer Gadgets on one block causing messy breakage.
			 * Fixed Refinery & Thermopneumatic Processing Plant GUI's wrongly reporting insufficient temperature even if the temperature is fine and machine is running properly.
			 * Programmer GUI: Fixed middle-click on rightmost column of expanded widget tray closing the tray instead of opening docs for the clicked widget
			 * Added a couple of missing Patchouli docs pages for programming widgets. A few other Patchouli docs fixes & updates too.
			 * Logistics frame info is now properly shown by The One Probe on dedicated server (previously just said "Error")
			 * Semiblocks (logistics frames, heat frames, etc.) no longer render for blinded players unless they're close enough to see the block the semiblock is on.
			 * Fixed Pneumatic Armor pieces not booting up on login if player isn't wearing the Pneumatic Helmet (this was due to the "master switch" being installed in the helmet - a holdover from when the helmet was the only armor piece).
			 * Fixed minor problem where placing a pressure chamber wall against another pressure chamber wall didn't play the block-place sound.
			 * Scaled down 8 programming widget textures with excessively large (256x256, ouch) textures sizes, saving a good chunk of texture atlas space.

			 * Pressure chamber textures don't look quite as flat now.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-1)Fixes

			 * Fixed two or more Transfer Gadgets on one block causing messy breakage.
			 * Fixed Refinery & Thermopneumatic Processing Plant GUI's wrongly reporting insufficient temperature even if the temperature is fine and machine is running properly.
			 * Programmer GUI: Fixed middle-click on rightmost column of expanded widget tray closing the tray instead of opening docs for the clicked widget
			 * Added a couple of missing Patchouli docs pages for programming widgets. A few other Patchouli docs fixes & updates too.
			 * Logistics frame info is now properly shown by The One Probe on dedicated server (previously just said "Error")
			 * Semiblocks (logistics frames, heat frames, etc.) no longer render for blinded players unless they're close enough to see the block the semiblock is on.
			 * Fixed Pneumatic Armor pieces not booting up on login if player isn't wearing the Pneumatic Helmet (this was due to the "master switch" being installed in the helmet - a holdover from when the helmet was the only armor piece).
			 * Fixed minor problem where placing a pressure chamber wall against another pressure chamber wall didn't play the block-place sound.
			 * Scaled down 8 programming widget textures with excessively large (256x256, ouch) textures sizes, saving a good chunk of texture atlas space.
