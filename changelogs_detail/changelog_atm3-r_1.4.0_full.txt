			!!! BACKUP YOUR WORLDS BEFORE UPDATING !!!

			With support for 1.13.x coming soon, I've made the first step and flattened all my blocks and items. This are the blocks/items affected:

			- Yellorite ore, Benitoite ore, Anglesite ore
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel metal blocks (and their item forms)
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel ingots and dusts
			- Benitoite and Anglesite crystals

			If you have those items in chests/storage/machines other then vanillas one YOU MUST move them to vanilla chests before updating or you end up loosing them.

			Many mods do not use the system vanilla have in place to address this kind of changes. Iron Chests form the Iron Chest mod are OK (if you are using version 1.12.2-7.0.59.842 or newer of Iron Chest the other chest types should be OK too)

			The full changelog is following

			 - Terran soil will increase the yield of the crop.

			- New spell:

			 - Iced Touch: turns water into ice, extinguishes fire and converts lava to obsidian.

			 - With the touch module (iron boots), automatically applies the effect to things they touch.
		Roots-1.12.2-3.0.2.jar:
			Changes

			- Fix the Imbuer recipe to use ore dictionary components.
			- The Wildwood Bow now has increased durability, enchantability, and auto-repairs at a significantly slower rate than other living tools.
			- Fix #129: Grove Stones no longer destroy farmland or fertile soil. Instead, they just plant pretty flowers and let grass grow how it will.
			- Fix #131: Fix the unlock requirements for Sense Danger (Spell), Windwall (Ritual).
			- Fix #127: The ritual of Purity no longer causes a concurrent modification error when removing potion effects.
			- Partially address #125: Rustic crops are specifically excluded from the Harvest spell.
			- Fix #128: Elemental soil converted into Magmatic soil in flowing lava is no longer immediately destroyed.
			- Fix #126: Upgrading the Component Pouch to the Apothecary Pouch once again retains the items, herbs & metadata of the original Component Pouch.
			- Note that, for the Wild Growth ritual, fully grown Wildroot crop is required.
			- Fix #124: Living arrows will now be picked up as living arrows, instead of "downgrading" them into normal arrows. This applies for those you shoot and those anyone else shoots. In addition, the break chance while picking up living arrows with the quiver is reduced to 0.
			- Fix #130: Properly set the new name of the Pyre Crafting Ritual so that serialisation functions correctly.
		Roots-1.12.2-3.0.1.jar:
			3.0.1

			Fixes

			- Fixed #121: Craft Tweaker integration for Pyre Crafting Rituals & Fey Crafting should now function as expected.

			- Fixed #123: Sure-Footed Stone no longer causes Server Crashes when placed near water; its functionality has now changed significantly (to be noticeable), in that it will moisturize faster but will not stop dry land from immediately turning back to dirt.

			- Fixed #120: al132mc: Fix some broken localisations.
		Roots-1.12.2-3.0.0.jar:
			- Initial Release of Roots 3
