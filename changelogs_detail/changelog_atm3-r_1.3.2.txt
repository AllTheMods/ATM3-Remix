	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (went from pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.0-357.jar to pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.3-366.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.3-366.jar:
			0.11.3-366 (20 Jun 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Hotfix: fix client crash on player login (an initialization error while migrating Pneumatic Armor HUD layout data)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#0112-365-19-jun-2019)0.11.2-365 (19 Jun 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#new)New

			 * Guardians (and Elder Guardians) can now be hacked with the Pneumatic Helmet to disable their ranged attack. In addition, hacking an Elder Guardian will cancel any Mining Fatigue you may have.
			 * Item Frames and Paintings can now be tracked (and hacked!) with the Pneumatic Helmet (entity tracker upgrade).
			 * Fluid tanks can now be tracked with the Pneumatic Helmet (block tracker upgrade).
			 * Villagers can now be hacked to reset the current trade list. There's also a small chance they might drop something they were trading...
			 * The Pneumatic Armor Jet Boots now come with a HUD display showing useful info like player velocity, altitude, heading etc.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Rewrite of the Pneumatic Helmet Block Tracker for huge client-side performance improvements: those painful FPS drops are drastically reduced.
			 * You may notice it takes slightly longer to start tracking new blocks as you look around (a second or two); this is due to much friendlier scanning of the surrounding area - scanning happens over multiple ticks.
			 * You can adjust the scan aggressiveness with the blockTrackerMaxTimePerTick client-side setting; this value limits scanning to the given percentage of a client tick (default: 10%). Raise this for faster block scanning at the possible expense of client-side performance.
			 * The animating marker arrows have been replaced with a more gently pulsing block outline for a smoother visual appearance.
			 * The Block Tracker is now side-aware, e.g. looking at the top of a Furnace will show different inventory contents than looking at the side of the Furnace.
			 * API break: IBlockTrackEntry#addInformation() now takes an extra EnumFacing side parameter.
			 * Item Search upgrade is also now much kinder to client-side performance.
			 * The green highlight markers for item searching now pulse gently, making it easier to spot them in some circumstances.
			 * Entity Tracker & Block Tracker: "Press [X] to hack" and "Press [X] to debug" messages now only appear if you're looking directly at the entity in question.
			 * Previous functionality of always showing the text was confusing since pressing the hack/debug keys does nothing if not focused on the target.
			 * API break: IEntityTrackEntry#addInfo() now takes an extra boolean isLookingAtTarget parameter.
			 * The GUI for moving Pneumatic Armor HUD elements has had some tweaks:
			 * There is now a "Snap to Grid" checkbox and associated grid size slider to make it easier to line elements up nicely
			 * To drag an element, you now need to click on the element to start the drag (previously you could click anywhere on the screen)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-1)Fixes

			 * Fixed Pneumatic Armor becoming non-functional after a dimension change and requiring a relog to start again.
			 * Fixed Redstone Tube Module channel display (via The One Probe) not working on dedicated server.
			 * Fixed drones often wrongly showing "Routine: Stopped" in Entity Tracker display, even when they're busy.
			 * Pneumatic Armor drone debugging: the debugged widgets now render on top of anything else in the armour GUI.
			 * Fixed occasional spurious "Insert in a charging station to install upgrades" message that occasionally wrongly appeared on some items that aren't insertable in a Charging Station.
			 * Fixed the upgraded Air Grate Module filter GUI ignoring the "!" entity filter blacklist prefix.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.1-361.jar:
			Updates

			 * Pneumatic Armor HUD panels (pressure, entity/block tracker, aircon etc.) now reposition themselves better if you change screen resolution and/or scaling.
			 * Positioning info is now stored as a resolution-independent proportion from 0.0 to 1.0 in config/pneumaticcraft/PneumaticArmorHUDLayout.cfg, migrated from the main config file ("helmet" section, which is now deprecated)
			 * Best efforts are made to migrate the layout, but you might need to reposition the panels (use the "Move X Stat" button for the relevant upgrade in the armor GUI) the first time you start up with this version. If you start the game up at the same resolution you usually play at, you should be fine.
			 * If your panels are aligned to the right-hand side of the screen, you should have them open to the left, and vice versa. This will ensure panels stay properly aligned if/when you change resolution and/or scaling. You can adjust the opening direction in the "Move X Stat" GUI for each panel.
			 * Logistics and Redstone Tube Modules can now communicate across tubes divided by inline modules such as the Regulator Module. Previously, inline modules blocked this communication.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed Plastic Mixer allowing items to be piped into the output slot.
			 * Fixed clicking the tank in the Liquid Compressor GUI causing the machine's redstone mode to be changed.
			 * Fixed problem where the Plastic Mixer "Item Selection" GUI side tab could sometimes be too small (depending on screen resolution), causing buttons to be outside the tab's area, and thus unclickable.
			 * Fixed Chestplate upgrades being missing in charging station upgrade GUI when Tough As Nails not installed.
