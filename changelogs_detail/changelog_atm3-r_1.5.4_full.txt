		ExtraCells-1.12.2-2.6.5:
			More fixes to OreDictExporter. Should've been released last month, but got busy IRL and forgot about it.
			Updated Russian language file thanks to [bigenergy (#671).](https://github.com/ExtraCells/ExtraCells2/commits?author=bigenergy)
			Please remove XCPatch if it is installed. It is no longer required, and will cause a crash if it is installed.

	Integrated Dynamics (IntegratedDynamics-1.12.2-1.1.1.jar --> IntegratedDynamics-1.12.2-1.1.2.jar):
		IntegratedDynamics-1.12.2-1.1.2.jar:
			As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
			Requires CyclopsCore version 1.6.0 or higher.
			Changes:
			* Improve performance of hasNext in list iterators
			 This used to cause performance issues with nested list concats.
			 Closes #800
			* Don't allow string joining on infinite lists
			Fixes:
			* Use item equality method from CommonCapabilities
			 This fixes issues where NBT tags are configured to be ignored
			 in CommonCaps, but this is not propagated to item comparisons in ID.
			 Closes #795
			* Make NBT representation of battery energy contents unique
			 Integrated Crafting would distinguish between identical batteries
			 obtained through different methods due to unequal NBT,
			 which is fixed by this commit.
			 Closes CyclopsMC/CommonCapabilitiesAPI#8
			* Fix the network diagnostic tool's box rendering
			 - Expand box evenly, not just towards positive x/y/z
			 - Render full block bounding boxes correctly
			* Fix some problems with the network diagnostic tool's click handler
			 - Fix teleporting to full blocks
			 - Prevent additional NullPointerExceptions in click handler. Those occur if you click a row that belongs to another dimension.
			 - Refresh table model every time something is (un)marked. This gives the user more immediate visual feedback for their actions.
			* Fix sorting and selection in the network diagnostic tool

	Roots (Roots-1.12.2-3.0.21.jar --> Roots-1.12.2-3.0.25.jar):
		Roots-1.12.2-3.0.25.jar:
			- A very small update to clarify that Summon Creatures recipes must be found in JEI as Patchouli has no capacity to expand the number of pages in an entry according to the number of items in an API processor, and it's not possible to properly pad out recipes so that the correct items (be they ore dictionary ingredients) match up with the correct outputs; manually entering defaults would make no sense, as these could easily be removed or modified.

		Roots-1.12.2-3.0.24.jar:
			- Enforce Forge 2847 to hopefully cut down on confusion and crash reports for people using lower versions.
			- Updated dependencies and fixed issue with wildwood leaves.
			- Removed Baubles as a required dependency; it's now optional again.

			Totally my bad.

			- Fixed #364, Spreading Forest ritual no longer crashes.
			- Fixed a typo (potals -> petals)
			- Fixed #363: give clearer feedback for Runic Shear recipe name conflicts from CraftTweaker
			- Fixed #362: only fully-grown crops are amplified by soils.
			- Potentially fixed #357: handle identical ingredients in recipes potentially causing crashes.
			- Crafting rituals can now auto-refill and auto-continue with the correct ingredients.
			- Resolve #334: sure-footed stone no longer requires hacks to avoid cobblestone conversion, sponge interactions, etc.
			- Chickens with a rider no longer count towards the Pacifist advancement. (i.e., chicken jockeys)
			- Implemented life essence: the essence of a creature (defaulting to the animal harvest list but clearable and adjustable via crafttweaker) These are obtained by sneak-clicking a creature with runic shears.
			- Overhauled Summon Creatures (#357). This now accepts inputs from multiple offering stones, and all creatures now have default recipes. It takes time (not a considerable amount of time) and can also accept life essence.
			- Implemented CraftTweaker support for Summon Creatures (PR is awaiting approval for documentation to be updated on main CraftTweaker docs)
			- Implemented JEI support for Summon Creatures (it only displays up to ten ingredients; if you add more I'll shake my fist at you)
			- Fixed #249: wildwood runes are no longer half-functional, as they were never properly documented. They now are purely a decorative object ratehr than a tile entity.
			- Finally fixed #162: removed the gravity from the Radiance particle beam so it appears as a beam.
			- Both Windwall and Sanctuary now use EntityUtil.isHostile.
			- Ritual and crafting conditions are now properly checked before restarting a ritual.
			- Runic Shears now play a sound when used on creatures.
			- It is now possible to disable the soil particles for elemental soil, under General->Disable Particles
			- Fixed #369: or rather, put a wall around it. If there is ever a null response from a module identification, the item treated as a module should be dropped instead of causing a crash.
			- Fixed #367: runic shears now act properly as shears when it comes to webs, leaves, grass, etc.
			- Fixed #372: life essences now display their uses (and reduced the default uses to 5)
